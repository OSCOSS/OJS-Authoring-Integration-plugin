HOW:
In OJSFWGatewayPlugin in  function fetch:

add this line:
echo getPOSTPayloadVariable('payloadvariable')

 and make a POST call the route:

 http://localhost:8000/ojs/index.php/TestJournalName/gateway/plugin/OJSFWGatewayPlugin/test

with the payload

variable                    value
payloadvariable       payloadvalue


EXPECTED:
you must see in the answer:
payloadvalue

RESULT: as expected.
