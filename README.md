   Fidus Writer side: https://github.com/fiduswriter/fiduswriter-ojs

2. Install OJS

An installation of OJS is needed. To install OJS please follow the instructions at https://github.com/pkp/ojs/

To install the latest version, please check out the master branch.

3. Download plugin files

Download and copy the plugin files from github into plugins/generic/fidusWriter inside your OJS folder.
Create the folder if it does not exist. You can achieve this by running these commands:

```
cd plugins/generic/
git clone https://github.com/fiduswriter/ojs-fiduswriter.git fidusWriter
cd ../..
```
3. Register plugin with OJS

Then, run the upgrade script to register the plugin with the system by running:

4. Activate plugin in OJS

Enable the plugin via the OJS website interface:

Make sure you have set up at least one journal on your site. Otherwise the settings menu does not show.

Open the OJS interface and select "ENABLE" under the settings "Fidus Writer Integration Plugin" under the following routes:

 setting > website > plugins
